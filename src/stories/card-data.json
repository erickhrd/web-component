      "description": "The Malayan tiger is a tiger from a specific population of the Panthera tigris tigris subspecies that is native to Peninsular Malaysia. This population inhabits the southern and central parts of the Malay Peninsula, and has been classified as critically endangered. As of April 2014, the population was estimated at 80â€“120 mature individuals, with a continuing downward trend. In the Malay language, the tiger is called harimau, also abbreviated to rimau. It has also been known as the southern Indochinese tiger, to further distinguish it from the Indochinese tiger population to the north in Myanmar and Thailand, which differ genetically from this population."
